Welcome to my professional space! I am a Senior Associate Product Manager at American Express, where my enthusiasm for product innovation has led to the successful launch of five products, enhancing user engagement and driving significant under-budget savings. My analytical acumen has enabled strategic product iterations, resulting in substantial growth in user retention and revenue.

Previously at HSBC Technology India, my role as a Business Analyst and Android Application Developer involved deploying secure digital solutions across global markets, earning me multiple accolades for my contributions. With a strong foundation in computer science and certifications in key industry technologies, this website is a portal to my work, my achievements, and the technological frontiers I'm passionate about exploring.
